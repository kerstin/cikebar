See See Bike Rider

Bikes are a great way to get around but biking is dangerous in many cities. One reason is that what bike riders see when riding is very different from what car drivers see. Car drivers don't see the potholes bike riders swerve to avoid, and too often this causes an accident. Our game seeks to show car drivers what it's like to ride a bike and bike riders what it's like to drive a car - seeing the world as it is, rather than as we are. It's a runner type game. First you ride a bike along the street attempting to avoid the hazards by tapping in the right or left bottom corners, to move the bike right or left. Then you switch to being a car driver, you drive the same street, and a bicyclist - who follows the same path (i.e. swerving to avoid hazards) you took when you were biking - is in front of you. We hope car drivers will learn that bike riders aren't simply riding recklessly, but rather avoiding the hazards that are part of riding a bike in the city. It's an educational game designed for people to play once. It could be used as part of driver education courses and as a public service game.
